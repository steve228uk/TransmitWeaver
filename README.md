# TransmitWeaver
**Decode Dreamweaver STE files and open them in Transmit**

This was built out of pure frustration of having to manually get details from Dreamweaver STE files sent to me by a client. It's not the greatest and it's definitely not tested but it works.

## Installation

Grab a signed build from the releases page or clone it and run `pod install`
